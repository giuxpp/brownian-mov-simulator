         Description:
            This program generates a desktop app that shows a 
            simulation for Brownian Movement of a bunch of balls. 
            The expectation is to get a Gaussian Bell at the end.
  
         Build Command:
            Since this code uses OpenGL library they need to be     
            called in the build command in the same order as in the
            include section. Use the next command:
            
*           g++ ./canica.cpp -o canica.out -lGL -lGLU -lglut
